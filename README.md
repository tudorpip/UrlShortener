# üßê Features

This project boasts a range of impressive features designed to provide a comprehensive URL shortening service. Below are some of the key highlights:

## Sleek Responsive Interface

- **Technology**: Built with React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Implementation**: The `client/` directory structure and dependencies such as `react` and `react-dom` in the `client/package.json` file underline the use of React for frontend development.

## Express Backend

- **Functionality**: Manages URL shortening logic and database interactions efficiently.
- **Technology Stack**: Utilizes Express.js, a robust server framework for Node.js.
- **Evidence**: The `server/` directory's structure and the inclusion of `express` in the `server/package.json` dependencies highlight the backend's foundation.

## PostgreSQL Database

- **Database Management**: Employs PostgreSQL for storing original and shortened URLs, facilitating quick data retrieval.
- **ORM Utilization**: Incorporates Sequelize as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, simplifying database interactions.
- **Configuration**: The presence of `pg` and `sequelize` in the `server/package.json` dependencies confirms the use of PostgreSQL and Sequelize.

## Easy Deployment

- **Deployment Tool**: Leverages Genezio for straightforward deployment, particularly beneficial for serverless applications.
- **Configuration and Documentation**: The `genezio.yaml` file in the `server/` directory, along with deployment instructions in the `README.md`, guide the deployment process.

These features collectively make the project not only a powerful tool for URL management but also a showcase of modern web development practices and technologies.
